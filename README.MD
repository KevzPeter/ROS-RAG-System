# Finetuned RAG Systems Engineering

> CS-GY 6613 Project: A RAG system that can be used by an ROS2 robotics developer to develop the navigation stack of a agent with egomotion. This means that the robotics is the domain but the system must be particularly helpful (be able to answer very specific questions about the subdomains). The subdomains are:  
> - ros2 robotics middleware subdomain.
> - nav2 navigation subdomain.
> - movit2 motion planning subdomain.
> - gazebo simulation subdomain.
